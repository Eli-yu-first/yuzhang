  This paper explores a dynamic task scheduling approach in edge-cloud collaborative computing to meet the requirements of modern cyber-physical systems and Industrial IoT applications. The proposed scheduling algorithm, DSOTS, optimizes server selection and reduces latency in time-sensitive tasks. Further enhancement through a greedy strategy, TSGS, achieves server load balancing and minimizes SLA violations. Simulation results in an edge-cloud environment indicate that DSOTS reduces average processing time and cost by 30% and 45%, respectively, and SLA violations by 25% over current solutions.
