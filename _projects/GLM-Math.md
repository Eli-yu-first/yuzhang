  Focused on pretraining of GLM-4 models, leveraging techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to enhance the model's ability to perform mathematical reasoning tasks. Research and reproduce the qwen and DeepSeek algorithms. Worked on improving the model's performance in solving complex mathematical problems by refining training strategies and optimizing the reasoning process.
