  I have developed an Office-tab plug-in for Mac users to help Microsoft Office users control the Office products on their Mac computers for tabbed multi-file management. Microsoft Office users currently face inefficiencies when managing multiple Office files as each opens in a separate window. Implementing a tab-based interface within Office applications significantly improves multi-file navigation and enhances productivity.
