 RM-PoT, a three-stage framework that integrates problem reformulation (RM), code-aided reasoning (PoT), and domain-aware few-shot learning to address these limitations. Our approach first reformulates the input problem into diverse surface forms to reduce structural bias, then retrieves five semantically aligned examples from a pre-constructed domain-specific question bank to provide contextual guidance, and finally generates executable Python code for precise computation.
