  This paper introduces the Segmentation Clustering Decision Tree (SCD-Tree) for interpretable rule-based explanations in unsupervised anomaly detection. The SCD-Tree dissects black-box models by clustering normal data distributions, integrating anomaly detection insights to enhance segmentation. The Gaussian Boundary Delineation (GBD) algorithm then refines these clusters, distinguishing normal from anomalous data with resilience to data drift. This method transforms complex anomaly detection into interpretable rules, demonstrated to improve explanation accuracy and robustness across various datasets, which is crucial for high-stakes fields such as network and IoT security.
