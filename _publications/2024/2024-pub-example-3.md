  Genos is an unsupervised anomaly-based network intrusion detection framework utilizing programmable switches for high-throughput, in-network deployment. Unlike existing solutions, Genos leverages rule extraction for model-agnostic detection, featuring a Model Compiler, Model Interpreter, and Model Debugger to enhance interpretability and maintainability. Through a tree-based clustering and divide-and-conquer approach, Genos partitions feature space into subspaces for accurate boundary estimation and reduces updating overhead by selectively fine-tuning affected subspaces. Evaluation on physical hardware shows its capabilities of achieving 100 Gbps throughput, high interpretability, and minimal maintenance costs.
