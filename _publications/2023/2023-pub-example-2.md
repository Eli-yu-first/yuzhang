  This paper introduces a post-hoc interpretability method for unsupervised anomaly detection in security by leveraging rule extraction. We propose distribution decomposition rules using an Interior Clustering Tree and Compositional Boundary Exploration (CBE) algorithm to decompose normal data distributions and approximate model decision boundaries. This approach provides interpretable explanations for anomaly detection models and allows the creation of a rule-based surrogate model for deployment. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method enhances model fidelity, correctness, and robustness, outperforming existing interpretability techniques in unsupervised anomaly detection.
