    As a Master’s student at Tsinghua University’s National School of Excellence in Engineering, my research focuses on advanced AI-accelerated chips and unsupervised anomaly detection models. I am currently a Research Assistant under Professor Qing Li’s team at the Pengcheng National Key Laboratory, where I specialize in network anomaly detection mechanisms for edge devices.

  <p>
  In addition, my ongoing projects at Tsinghua’s AI Lab and within the smart factory domain address challenges in model compression and task scheduling. Notably, I have designed adaptive knowledge distillation techniques to compress visual models for CVPR 2025 submission and developed time-sensitive scheduling algorithms to enhance Edge-Cloud computing efficiency in industrial applications. Beyond research, I co-founded a software outsourcing studio, and my work in applied AI has earned national awards, including two gold medals in China’s Internet+ Innovation Competition. My skill set includes Java, Python, machine learning frameworks, and distributed computing platforms like Spark and Hadoop.
