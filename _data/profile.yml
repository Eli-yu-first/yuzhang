      As a <a href="https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/529d362404814d9abbf2/" target="_blank">Master’s student at Tsinghua University</a> ’s National School of Excellence in Engineering, my research focuses on large model such as LLMs and VLMs, and unsupervised anomaly detection models. I am currently a GLM-4 Pretraining Algorithm Research Assistant at Zhipu AI, focusing on enhancing the model’s performance in mathematical reasoning tasks through advanced techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). I have also contributed to the development of cutting-edge algorithms such as Qwen and DeepSeek. In addition to my research experience, I lead a technical team under the National Key Research and Development Program (NKRDP), where we develop forecasting models to support strategic decision-making in the context of China’s dual-carbon goal. My leadership role at the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory led to the successful compression of the VIT visual model framework by 90%, maintaining accuracy. I have also worked at Pengcheng National Laboratory, contributing to AI algorithms for anomaly detection, and at Mercedes-Benz Group, where I helped optimize energy consumption in building systems using digital twin technology.

    In parallel with my academic pursuits, I have a strong entrepreneurial background. I co-founded Nanjing Zhuyu Information Technology Co., Ltd., where I led multiple software development projects, gaining insights into big data processing, algorithm optimization, and market trends. My ability to convert research into practical applications has shaped my vision of creating user-friendly AI-driven solutions. I thrive in high-pressure environments, possess excellent multitasking skills, and enjoy collaborating with diverse teams to drive innovation. My interests include traveling, sports, and reading.
